# Weather to Drink or Not? That is the Question.

## Team 

* Lavar Cole
* Jon Bodnar
* Aruna Kolli
* Kaiisha Oliver

## Description 

### Basic 

Our app takes a user's location input. This information is used to pull weather data from OpenWeather.org. Temperature information for the location is then used behind the scenes to determine likely available drink ingredients. The drink ingredients are then used to pull selected/suggested drinks from the CocktailDB. A list/table below the input is then populated with the location name, temperature, and suggested drinks and images of them.

### Beyond the Basic

* Store responses to localStorage (or firebase), allow keeping/deleting
* Add a button so that people can pull chuck norris facts
* Use browser geolocation to let user pull location based on current location (lat and lon) with one button click
* Have drink image link out to a google search "how do i make x"

## APIs & Other Technologies

* [OpenWeather for weather details](https://openweathermap.org/)
* [TheCocktailDB for drinks and links to drinks recipes](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)
* [GeoLocation API to get location information for user](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
* [Wing CSS Framework as an alternative css framework](https://kbrsh.github.io/wing/)
* [NumbersAPI for number and date facts](http://numbersapi.com/#42)
* [Unsplash's Random Image API for background image](https://source.unsplash.com/)

## Tasks

* Develop project proposal
* Make and revise sketch 
* Figure out how weather api works
* Figure out how drink api works
* Figure out how GeoLocation API works
* Figure out how to collaboratively use github
* Make the design responsive
* Figure out how to use Wing framework
* Pseudocode key parts of application
* Divide coding tasks/responsibilities among ourselves
* Build the front end
* Map temperature to ingredients categories

### Pseudo Code

``` 

<!-- P R O J E C T _ O N E _ P S E U D O C O D E  -->
<!-- Step One: Setting Up Variables  -->
<!-- Set Arrays for different ingredients based on weather -->
<!-- I.E: cold_weather_ingred, hot_weather_ingred -->
<!-- Set variables for Latitude, Longitude, Weather (Convert from Kelvin to Farenheit), etc-->
<!-- Step Two: Setting Up Functions -->
<!-- Ajax Calls for Each API used returning responses (named for each expected type of response) -->
<!-- Function to convert Kelvin to Farenheit -->
<!-- Geolocation Function to get Latitude and Longitude -->
<!-- Listening/ Click Events for 
            1.User Typed Location 

            2. Button that gets Geolocation-->

<!-- Step Three: JQuery -->
<!-- Dynamic Loading of HTML -->
<!-- This will be for "automatic" loading of 
        

        1. Drink Options
        2. Weather Forecast
        3. List of Selected Drinks
        4. Other information To Be Determined -->
